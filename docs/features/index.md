# Features

Qlever-UI is built around the [Qlue-ls](https://github.com/IoannisNezis/Qlue-ls)
SPARQL language server, which runs as WebAssembly directly in your browser —
no round-trips to a server for editor intelligence.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- **[Editor](editor.md)**

    A Monaco-based SPARQL editor with context-aware completion, a powerful
    formatter, diagnostics, code actions, hover, and automatic prefix
    management.

- **[Results](results.md)**

    Result views for *any* SPARQL operation — including updates on QLever
    endpoints — with type and language annotations, IRI shortening, and a
    map view for geometry results.

- **[Query Analysis](analysis.md)**

    Watch QLever execute your query live in the Query Execution Tree View,
    inspect the parse tree, and iterate on completion templates.

- **[Workbench](workbench.md)**

    Tabs for multiple queries, query sharing via short links, a settings
    panel, keyboard shortcuts, and a command prompt.
