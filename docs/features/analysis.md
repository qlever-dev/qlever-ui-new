# Query Analysis

Beyond writing and running queries, Qlever-UI offers tooling to understand
*how* a query is parsed and executed.

## Query Execution Tree View

For QLever endpoints (`engine: QLever`), Qlever-UI can show the engine's
query execution tree **live, while the query runs**. Open it with the
`analysis` command (`Ctrl+P`), then watch each operation in the tree fill up with
runtime statistics as QLever processes it — ideal for spotting the expensive
parts of a slow query.

!!! note "Direct WebSocket connection"
    Live monitoring uses a WebSocket opened directly from your browser to
    the QLever backend — it does not pass through the Qlever-UI server.
    The QLever endpoint must therefore be reachable from the user's browser.

## Parse Tree View

The Parse Tree View shows the internal representation of your SPARQL query
as the language server sees it — the full concrete syntax tree, updating
live as you type. Open it with the `parseTree` command (`Ctrl+P`).

This is mostly a tool for the curious and for anyone working on Qlue-ls
itself, but it is also handy for understanding why a query fails to parse.

## Completion Template Editor

The completion behavior of an endpoint is driven by its
[completion query templates](../configuration/endpoints.md#completion-query-templates).
The Completion Template Editor (`templates` command) lets you edit those
templates **live in the UI** and immediately try the resulting completions —
no backend restart, no YAML round-trips. Once a template works, persist it to
the endpoint configuration.
