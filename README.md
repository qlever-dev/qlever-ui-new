    Qlever-UI
</h1>

**Qlever-UI** is a modern WebUI for **SPARQL**, driven by [Qlue-ls](https://github.com/IoannisNezis/Qlue-ls).
It does not target a single, but **many** SPARQL engines.  
It’s small, shiny, and ready to help you explore your RDF data effortlessly.  

> [!WARNING]
> **Work in progress — expect breaking changes.**
>
> This project is the next generation of **Qlever-UI**, but the migration from
> the legacy version is still ongoing. The API, configuration format, and
> internal structure may change significantly between releases.
>
> The project will be considered stable and final once it reaches **version 1.0**.
> Until then, use at your own risk.
